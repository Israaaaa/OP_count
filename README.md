# OP_count
These two scripts are used to three most used operations in a log file of the format:
[timestamp]	/[user]/[operation]

------------------------------------------------------

To use:
1. First clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Israaaaa/OP_count.git

2. Edit the file path in both scripts. 

The first script which is logs_fast.pl requiers one file path, which is the path to the log file. 
The second script which is logs.pl, however, requires two file paths. One is the path to the log file, and the other is for a temporary file created by the script.
